# ServerUtils

Here you can find multiple scripts for managing ubuntu server systems. I am using those on multiple systems, so most of them are in active development.

Special attention is being spend on all the LXD-related stuff, those are in active use and developed further every time I see the need for improvement or find a bug.

If you are using those scripts and see something which does look wrong, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request! I will happily get in touch with you to get it merged.
