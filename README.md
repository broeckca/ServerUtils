# ServerUtils
This repo contains my scripts for managing multiple debian servers.
Most of this scripts will probably not be relevant for you, but it is easier for me to just dump my stuff in here ;)

## backup.s&#8203;h
This utility will backup your data to a network storage server, mounted over NFS.
Following data is backed up:
* MySQL databases
* system packages (apt)
* custom additional folders

The tool needs the following binaries to be installed:
* obnam (for incremental backups)
* apt-clone (for package backup)
* mysql (obviously..)
* dpkg-repack (for package backup)
* nfs-common (for mounting remote storage)

Every backup after the first one is incremental.
Obnam uses deduplication and you can delete any backup generation without manipulating the others. For more information see obnam.org.
